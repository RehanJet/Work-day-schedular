# Work-day-schedular

## Description

I wanted to make a planner for myself to better plan out my events and day to day things. To make things more clear the hours coordinate to a certain color to a regular day with grey already past, red meaning present, green meaning upcoming. While doing this I was able to learn more about how to write better functions that relate to JQuery.
